# PNAS_2021
Code for creating the figures in Chariker et al. (2021), A theory of direction selectivity for macaque primary visual cortex.

The Matlab scripts here can be used to reproduce figs 2-5 of the paper.  Each script is self-contained, with function definitions written at the bottom of each file.

fig2.m plots the temporal and spatial kernels shown in fig 2.

fig3.m reproduces the OFF, ON, and OFF+ON responses shown in the center and right columns of fig 3A,B.  The TF response curves in fig 3D are also reproduced.

fig4.m reproduces all of the panels of fig 4 except for the leftmost panels of 4A,B depicting the temporal kernels.

fig5.m reproduces the matrix of SF response plots shown in fig 5.
